        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        We were intened to use the freecodecamp website to gain certification for the projects completed and complete a project within a designated time.
        My expereience with the freecodecamp was laggy at first but I got used to if after sometime.
        I also managed to host a created HTML file on a free domain name, hosting was difficult at first but I managed to host it after sometime.
        The time durations given for the freecodecamp projects were quite short given we had other coursees to also study so i had to make more time to complete the freecodecamp projects which i did.
